## Research Interests

<img src="images/ResearchOverview.png" width="900"/> 

My current resarch experience spans over development of learning based controllers for motion planning and control of wide range of robot platforms and applications (skid-steered wheeled mobile robots, ackerman steered car like robots, cable driven parallel robots and robotic arms). My work emphasizes leveraging the underlying geometric robot motion models for structuring and accelerating control policy learning. Apart from physical deployments, my experience also includes utilizing containerzied high power compute for enabling rapid robot learning.
